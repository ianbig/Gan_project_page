The above process is a complete guide on how a shoes desinger design a shoes. In order to design a masterpiece, the designer has to corporate with shoes maker. If one process went wrong, the whole flow has to start from the beginning.

## Project goal
In order to elminate this tedious and time-costing workflow, we propose to use the cutting edge technology: GAN to free the worry of designer.Thusm We use Paired Cycle GAN as design model to create new style of shoes


## Project feature

* Use Paired Cycle GAN as design model
* Conventient Web UI for testing 

## Environment Setup
1. Setup conda: installation guide https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/
2. Setup environment: conda create —name “py36” python=3.6
3. Install tensorflow: conda install tesorflow
4. install xampp for your prefer version
5. place training dataset under public/data and launch your xampp. Then you can start testing :)

## Things to notice
* hardware requirement: you must have gpu in your computer to run the code !!!
